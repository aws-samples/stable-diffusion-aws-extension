## Multiple User Management
### Add New User
1. To meet your specific requirements, create new users, passwords, and roles. Once you click on "Next Page," the newly created users will be visible. To ensure the configuration changes related to the new users take effect in the web UI server, it is necessary to restart the web UI again.
